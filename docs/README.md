# Came Coffee Shop Application Diagrams

This directory contains sequence and collaboration diagrams for the Came Coffee Shop application.

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams are written in Mermaid syntax. You can view them in several ways:
1. Using GitHub's built-in Mermaid renderer
2. Using the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)
3. Using a Markdown editor with Mermaid support (like VS Code with the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension)

## Diagram Types

- **Sequence Diagrams**: Show how objects interact with each other and in what order
- **Collaboration Diagrams**: Focus on the relationship between objects rather than the timing of interactions
